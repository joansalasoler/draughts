/**
 * This simple heuristic function evaluates the position of pieces on
 * a draughts board to estimate who has the advantage.
 *
 * Here's the method that was used to derive this function:
 *
 *  1. Generate a set of random game states that are not final. Ensure
 *     this states include both positions with regular pieces and
 *     positions with many kings
 *  2. Focus only on positions that contain kings and use a MCTS algorithm
 *     with random simulations ({@link Montecarlo}) to estimate their
 *     value. Each position is evaluated for a short time (100 ms).
 *  3. For each position, we record information about each player, such
 *     as the number of regular pieces, number of kings, and whether one
 *     player has a king advantage.
 *  4. Use linear regression to determine how important each feature is
 *     in predicting the advantage. These weights are used to build a
 *     basic heuristic evaluation function {@link MaterialScorer}.
 *  5. Now we want to refine the {@link MaterialScorer} with positional
 *     information. Use the {@link MaterialScorer} function along with
 *     the {@link Negamax} engine to evaluate the full training set
 *     again for a short time (100 ms).
 *  6. Remove positions where the exact outcome (win or loss) is known
 *     because we want to predict the material advantage rather than the
 *     exact game outcome.
 *  7. For each position, create a set of features representing a piece
 *     type occupying a checker. Each feature is a binary value (1 or 0)
 *     indicating whether a specific piece type (man or king) occupies
 *     that checker. For the opponent, rotate the board 180 degrees.
 *  8. Augment the training set. To make the evaluation function symmetric,
 *     mirror each position in the training set. Flip the board and adjust
 *     the scores to create a mirrored version for the other player.
 *  9. Use linear regression again, to further improve the accuracy of
 *     the {@link MaterialScorer} function using positinal information.
 *     Determine how much weight to give to each type of piece on each
 *     square of the board.
 * 10. The final heuristic function combines {@link MaterialScorer}
 *     with the newly learned weights for each piece on each square.
 *     Adjust the weights to guarantee that the heuristic function always
 *     outputs scores between {@code Â±MAX_SCORE} (exclusive).
